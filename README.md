# optamized-inference-pipeline

Utilize OpenCV’s optimized image processing techniques (e.g., resizing, filtering, and augmentation) to preprocess input data in real-time, ensuring minimal latency during inference.
Incorporate pre-trained deep learning models (e.g., YOLO, MobileNet) with OpenCV’s DNN module for efficient and accelerated inference, taking advantage of hardware acceleration like CUDA or OpenCL for performance boosts.
Apply OpenCV functions for post-processing, such as non-max suppression and bounding box visualization, to streamline result handling and provide real-time feedback or visualization outputs.
